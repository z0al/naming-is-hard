## The problem

Based on this ðŸ‘‡ (and other similar posts but I can't find them) I think we need a format similar to RSS/ATOM so people can use a more private platform (e.g. their websites) to publish and share notes.

## The Proposal

See the [specification draft](./spec/v1.md)

## Goal

Our goal is to support authors to publish short posts anywhere without being locked in a single platform while providing an easy way for others interested to follow their publishing.

Typically we aim to support these kinds of content:

- Short (more or less a tweet size ), plain text only, untitled, posts.
- Posts with only images or videos.
- Mix of above.
